# Converting-mouse-to-human-gene-names-with-biomaRt-package
Converting mouse gene names to the human equivalent and vice versa is not always as straightforward as it seems, so I wrote a function to simplify the task. The function takes advantage of the getLDS() function from the biomaRt to get the hgnc symbol equivalent from the mgi symbol. For example, letâ€™s convert the following mouse gene symbols, Hmmr, Tlx3, and Cpeb4, to their human equivalent.
